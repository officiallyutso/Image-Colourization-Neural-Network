# Image-Colourization-Neural-Network
Using Python and neural networks, I created a project to automatically colorize black and white images. The model operates in the LAB color space, predicting 'a' and 'b' channels from the luminance channel ('L'). Trained on paired grayscale/color images, it accurately restores vibrant colors, merging image processing with deep learning for realism
